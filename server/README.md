Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è
This project is configured for a professional CI/CD pipeline.

Backend: The server is containerized using a multi-stage Dockerfile and is set up for continuous deployment on Render.

Frontend: The client is configured for continuous deployment on Vercel.

Automation: A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) automates the entire process. On every push to the main branch, it runs backend tests, and if they pass, it triggers deployments on both Vercel and Render.
